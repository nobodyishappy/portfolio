			`<h2>Short Introduction</h2>
            <p>I am a Year 4 student from the School of Computing. 
                My major is in Computer Science and I am taking a Minor in Interactive Media Design.<br>
                I have interest in 3D modeling and game development. From mobile to VR games, I have worked on different projects with various themes.
                </p>
            <br>
            <h2>What I hope to take away from the course?</h2>
            <p>After taking a few design modules, I realised that I do not have enough exprience with 2D design. 
                During my internship at Straits Times, this realization became more prominent and obvious.
                I hope that this module would allow me to gain more insights on the different aspects of design and gain valuable feedback on my current designs.
                </p>`
