                    We decided to go with contextual inquiry as we wanted a method that would be able to get the most realistic and informational data from the users.`

                    I roughly knew the general process for the application itself. After getting through the CI,

                    One interesting factor was the fact that the number of people in queue caught his attention when he was choosing a store to eat from.

                    the issue that was brought up the most was the login issues followed by the payment problems. However, there might been updates over the past two year which was able to fix the issue.

                    The experience was with the application for graduation process. This process requires us to start off by submitting a what-if report on our planned courses for the upcoming semester. 
                    The main issue I faced was with the course selection process. The course selection process consists of a selection of alphabets to select the first letter of your course code and followed by a dropdown to select your course. 
                    The worst part is that selecting causes the page to exit back and you will have to do the entire selection again.`
